# Task ID: 11
# Title: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure GitHub Actions for automated daily execution
# Details:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml) that: 1) Runs on a daily schedule, 2) Sets up the Python environment and installs dependencies, 3) Configures necessary secrets and environment variables, 4) Executes the main script, 5) Handles and reports errors, 6) Optionally sends notifications on completion or failure. Consider implementing timeout and retry mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Test the workflow with a manual trigger. Verify it completes successfully and produces expected results. Test error reporting by introducing a deliberate error.
