# Task ID: 7
# Title: Data Processing Module - Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement data validation and formatting for phone numbers and emails
# Details:
Extend the DataProcessor class with validation methods: 1) Implement regex patterns for validating email formats, 2) Create phone number validation and formatting for LATAM countries (considering country codes), 3) Add a data quality score calculation based on completeness of records, 4) Flag invalid or suspicious data entries. Ensure all data is consistently formatted before storage.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various valid and invalid email formats and phone numbers from different LATAM countries. Verify formatting is consistent and invalid data is properly flagged.

# Completion Date: 2025-05-04

# Summary:
The ValidationProcessor has been successfully implemented with all the required functionality. The processor can validate and format emails and phone numbers (with special handling for LATAM countries), calculate data quality scores, and flag suspicious data. Unit tests and a demo script have been created to showcase the functionality. The implementation includes comprehensive documentation in the codebase and a separate markdown file.

# Key Implementation Details:
1. Created ValidationProcessor class with comprehensive email validation using regex
2. Implemented phone number validation and formatting with country-specific support for LATAM
3. Added data quality scoring algorithm with customizable field weights
4. Implemented suspicious data detection for generic/test emails and phone patterns
5. Added comprehensive documentation with usage examples and supported countries
6. Created unit tests covering all functionality with edge cases
7. Implemented a demo script to showcase the validation features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Email Validation with Regex Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the DataProcessor class with methods to validate email formats using regular expressions
### Details:
1. Create a new method `validateEmail(email)` in the DataProcessor class that returns a boolean indicating validity
2. Implement regex patterns that validate standard email formats (username@domain.tld)
3. Handle edge cases like subdomains, special characters in usernames, and various TLDs
4. Add a `formatEmail(email)` method that normalizes email addresses (e.g., trimming whitespace, converting to lowercase)
5. Write unit tests with various valid and invalid email formats
6. Test with edge cases like international domains and unusual but valid formats
7. Document the regex patterns used and their validation logic

## 2. Implement Phone Number Validation for LATAM Countries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add phone number validation and formatting functionality with support for LATAM country codes
### Details:
1. Create a `validatePhoneNumber(phoneNumber, countryCode)` method in DataProcessor class
2. Research and implement country code validation for major LATAM countries (Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, etc.)
3. Create a mapping of country codes to expected phone number formats
4. Implement regex patterns for each country's phone number format
5. Add a `formatPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, countryCode)` method that standardizes format (e.g., +XX-XXX-XXXX-XXXX)
6. Handle cases where country code might be embedded in the number or provided separately
7. Write unit tests with sample phone numbers from different LATAM countries
8. Test edge cases like numbers with/without country codes, different separators, etc.

## 3. Implement Data Quality Scoring and Flagging [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Add functionality to calculate data quality scores and flag suspicious entries
### Details:
1. Create a `calculateDataQualityScore(record)` method that evaluates completeness of records
2. Define scoring criteria based on presence and validity of required fields
3. Implement weighted scoring where critical fields (like email, phone) have higher importance
4. Add a `flagSuspiciousData(record)` method that identifies potentially invalid entries
5. Define criteria for suspicious data (e.g., dummy emails, sequential phone numbers)
6. Create a comprehensive `validateRecord(record)` method that applies all validation rules and returns validation results
7. Ensure all data is consistently formatted before storage by creating a `prepareForStorage(record)` method
8. Write integration tests that validate complete records through the entire validation pipeline
9. Document the scoring algorithm and flagging criteria for future reference
