# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement data validation and formatting for phone numbers and emails
# Details:
Extend the DataProcessor class with validation methods: 1) Implement regex patterns for validating email formats, 2) Create phone number validation and formatting for LATAM countries (considering country codes), 3) Add a data quality score calculation based on completeness of records, 4) Flag invalid or suspicious data entries. Ensure all data is consistently formatted before storage.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various valid and invalid email formats and phone numbers from different LATAM countries. Verify formatting is consistent and invalid data is properly flagged.
