# Task ID: 8
# Title: Google Sheets Integration - Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up authentication and connection to Google Sheets API
# Details:
Create a GoogleSheetsIntegration class that handles: 1) OAuth2 authentication using service account credentials, 2) Loading credentials from environment variables or a secure file, 3) Connecting to the Google Sheets API using gspread, 4) Creating new spreadsheets or accessing existing ones, 5) Managing permissions and sharing settings. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication with valid and invalid credentials. Verify connection to test spreadsheets. Ensure proper error messages are displayed when authentication fails.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement OAuth2 authentication with service account credentials [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation of the GoogleSheetsIntegration class with authentication functionality using service account credentials and secure credential loading
### Details:
1. Create a new GoogleSheetsIntegration class
2. Implement methods to load credentials from environment variables (using os.environ)
3. Add fallback to load credentials from a secure file (JSON key file)
4. Implement the authentication method using OAuth2 and service account credentials
5. Add proper error handling for authentication failures (invalid credentials, network issues, etc.)
6. Create a method to validate if authentication was successful
7. Write unit tests using mocking to verify authentication flow works correctly
8. Document the authentication process and required credential format

## 2. Implement Google Sheets API connection using gspread [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Extend the GoogleSheetsIntegration class to establish connection with Google Sheets API using gspread library and implement spreadsheet access methods
### Details:
1. Add gspread as a dependency and import it in the class
2. Create a method to establish connection to Google Sheets API using the authenticated credentials from subtask 1
3. Implement methods to access existing spreadsheets by ID or URL
4. Add functionality to create new spreadsheets with specified names
5. Implement error handling for API connection issues and rate limiting
6. Create helper methods to validate spreadsheet existence
7. Add connection pooling or caching if appropriate to avoid repeated authentication
8. Write integration tests that verify connection to the API works (using a test spreadsheet)
9. Document the connection methods and their parameters

## 3. Implement permission management and sharing settings [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Complete the GoogleSheetsIntegration class by adding functionality to manage permissions and sharing settings for spreadsheets
### Details:
1. Implement methods to check current permissions of a spreadsheet
2. Add functionality to share spreadsheets with specific users by email
3. Implement methods to set different permission levels (viewer, editor, owner)
4. Add ability to make spreadsheets public or private
5. Implement methods to remove sharing permissions
6. Add proper error handling for permission-related operations
7. Create utility methods to validate email addresses and permission levels
8. Write integration tests to verify permission changes work correctly
9. Document all permission-related methods and provide usage examples
10. Ensure all methods follow a consistent error handling pattern established in previous subtasks
