# Task ID: 15
# Title: Documentation - Technical Reference
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create technical documentation for developers
# Details:
Create technical documentation including: 1) System architecture overview, 2) Module descriptions and interactions, 3) How to extend the system with new scrapers, 4) API references for key classes, 5) Deployment options beyond GitHub Actions, 6) Security considerations and best practices, 7) Known limitations and future improvement areas. Use docstrings throughout the code and consider generating API docs with a tool like Sphinx.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for completeness and accuracy. Verify that all major components and functions are documented. Ensure code examples are correct and functional.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create System Architecture and Module Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation covering system architecture overview and module descriptions with interactions
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a 'docs/technical/' directory structure
2. Develop a system architecture document (docs/technical/architecture.md) that includes:
   - High-level system architecture diagram (consider using PlantUML or Mermaid)
   - Component breakdown and responsibilities
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Technology stack overview
3. Create module documentation (docs/technical/modules.md) that includes:
   - Description of each major module/component
   - Module dependencies and interactions
   - Class hierarchy diagrams where appropriate
   - Initialization and execution flow
4. Ensure documentation follows a consistent format with proper headings, tables, and diagrams
5. Testing approach: Have at least one other developer review the documentation for clarity, completeness, and accuracy

## 2. Implement Code-Level Documentation and API References [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Add comprehensive docstrings throughout the codebase and generate API reference documentation
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Review and update docstrings throughout the codebase following a consistent format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style)
2. Ensure all classes, methods, and functions have appropriate docstrings including:
   - Description of purpose
   - Parameter descriptions with types
   - Return value descriptions with types
   - Exception information
   - Usage examples where helpful
3. Set up Sphinx documentation generation:
   - Install Sphinx and necessary extensions
   - Configure Sphinx (conf.py) to extract docstrings
   - Create appropriate .rst files for documentation structure
   - Generate HTML documentation
4. Create API reference documentation (docs/technical/api_reference.md) for key classes
5. Testing approach:
   - Run Sphinx documentation build and verify no errors/warnings
   - Check generated HTML documentation for completeness
   - Verify all key classes are properly documented

## 3. Create Extension, Deployment, and Security Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Document system extension procedures, deployment options, security considerations, and future improvements
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create extension guide (docs/technical/extending.md) that includes:
   - Step-by-step instructions for adding new scrapers
   - Templates or examples for common extension patterns
   - Testing requirements for extensions
2. Document deployment options (docs/technical/deployment.md):
   - GitHub Actions configuration details
   - Alternative deployment methods (Docker, serverless, etc.)
   - Environment configuration requirements
   - Scaling considerations
3. Create security documentation (docs/technical/security.md):
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Data handling best practices
   - Input validation requirements
   - Common security pitfalls to avoid
4. Document known limitations and future improvements (docs/technical/roadmap.md):
   - Current system constraints
   - Planned enhancements
   - Technical debt items
   - Contribution guidelines
5. Create a main index.md file that links to all documentation sections
6. Testing approach:
   - Verify all links between documents work
   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the system attempt to follow the extension guide
   - Review security documentation with team for completeness
