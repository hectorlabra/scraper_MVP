# Task ID: 4
# Title: Public Directories Scraper Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create modules to scrape business data from public directories
# Details:
Implement a DirectoryScraper class using BeautifulSoup and Requests/Selenium as needed. Create specific implementations for at least 2 public directories (e.g., chambers of commerce, yellow pages). Each implementation should: 1) Navigate to the directory, 2) Search by category and location, 3) Extract business name, category, phone, and other available data, 4) Handle pagination. Design with extensibility in mind to easily add more directories later.

# Test Strategy:
Test each directory scraper with different search parameters. Verify data extraction by comparing with manual checks. Test with different business categories and locations.
