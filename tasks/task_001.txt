# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize project structure, create virtual environment, and set up dependencies
# Details:
Create a new Python project with the following structure: main.py, scrapers/ (directory for scraper modules), processors/ (for data processing), integrations/ (for Google Sheets), utils/ (for helper functions). Set up requirements.txt with necessary packages: selenium, beautifulsoup4, pandas, gspread, google-auth, instaloader, undetected-chromedriver. Create a .env file template for storing credentials and configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is correct, ensure all dependencies can be installed in a clean environment, and confirm imports work without errors.
