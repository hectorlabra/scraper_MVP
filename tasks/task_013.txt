# Task ID: 13
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the scrapers and data processing for better performance
# Details:
Review and optimize the codebase for performance: 1) Implement parallel scraping where possible (using ThreadPoolExecutor or similar), 2) Optimize Selenium usage (minimize browser instances, use headless mode), 3) Improve data processing efficiency for large datasets, 4) Implement caching mechanisms to avoid re-scraping unchanged data, 5) Add progress tracking for long-running operations.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance before and after optimizations. Verify that optimizations don't affect data quality or reliability. Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Parallel Scraping with ThreadPoolExecutor [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the scraping code to use parallel execution for improved performance
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify scraping functions that can be parallelized (those without shared state or dependencies)
2. Implement a ThreadPoolExecutor-based solution to run multiple scraping tasks concurrently
3. Add configuration for controlling the maximum number of concurrent workers
4. Implement proper exception handling for parallel tasks
5. Add progress tracking for parallel operations using a shared counter and logging

Testing approach:
- Compare execution time between sequential and parallel implementations
- Verify all data is correctly scraped in parallel mode
- Test with different numbers of workers to find optimal configuration
- Ensure proper error handling when a worker thread fails

## 2. Optimize Selenium Usage and Browser Management [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Reduce resource usage by optimizing how browser instances are created and managed
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure all browser instances to use headless mode by default
2. Implement a browser instance pool to reuse browsers instead of creating new ones
3. Add browser resource cleanup to ensure browsers are properly closed
4. Optimize page load strategy (set to 'eager' or 'none' when full page isn't needed)
5. Implement intelligent waiting strategies (replace fixed sleeps with explicit/implicit waits)
6. Minimize DOM interactions and use more efficient selectors

Testing approach:
- Monitor memory usage before and after optimization
- Measure page load and scraping times
- Verify scraping still works correctly with headless browsers
- Test browser pool under various load conditions

## 3. Implement Caching and Data Processing Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Add caching mechanisms and optimize data processing for large datasets
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a caching system to store scraped data with timestamps
2. Add logic to check cache validity before scraping (based on configurable TTL)
3. Optimize data processing algorithms for large datasets:
   - Use generators for memory-efficient processing
   - Implement batch processing for large datasets
   - Replace inefficient data structures with more appropriate ones
4. Add incremental processing capability to handle only new/changed data
5. Implement progress tracking for long-running data processing operations

Testing approach:
- Measure processing time for large datasets before and after optimization
- Verify cache correctly prevents unnecessary re-scraping
- Test memory usage during processing of large datasets
- Validate data integrity after optimization changes
