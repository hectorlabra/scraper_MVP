# Task ID: 13
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize the scrapers and data processing for better performance
# Details:
Review and optimize the codebase for performance: 1) Implement parallel scraping where possible (using ThreadPoolExecutor or similar), 2) Optimize Selenium usage (minimize browser instances, use headless mode), 3) Improve data processing efficiency for large datasets, 4) Implement caching mechanisms to avoid re-scraping unchanged data, 5) Add progress tracking for long-running operations.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance before and after optimizations. Verify that optimizations don't affect data quality or reliability. Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability.
