# Task ID: 5
# Title: Instagram Scraper Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a module to extract business profiles from Instagram based on hashtags and locations
# Details:
Implement an InstagramScraper class using Instaloader or Selenium. The scraper should: 1) Search for posts by hashtags or locations relevant to LATAM businesses, 2) Extract profile information from post authors, 3) Collect profile bio, location, and contact information when available, 4) Handle Instagram's rate limiting and authentication requirements. Consider implementing session management to avoid frequent logins.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various hashtags and locations. Verify profile data extraction accuracy. Test rate limiting handling by running multiple searches. Ensure compliance with Instagram's terms of service.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up InstagramScraper class with authentication and session management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base InstagramScraper class with authentication functionality and session management to handle Instagram's rate limiting
### Details:
1. Create an InstagramScraper class with constructor accepting credentials
2. Implement login functionality using either Instaloader or Selenium (Selenium recommended for more robust scraping)
3. Add session management to store cookies and avoid frequent logins
4. Implement rate limiting protection with exponential backoff and random delays
5. Add error handling for authentication failures
6. Create a method to check login status
7. Test the authentication flow with valid and invalid credentials
8. Implement a session recovery mechanism if disconnected

## 2. Implement hashtag and location search functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add methods to search Instagram for posts by hashtags and locations relevant to LATAM businesses
### Details:
1. Create a method to search posts by hashtag (e.g., searchByHashtag(tag, limit))
2. Implement a method to search posts by location (e.g., searchByLocation(location_id, limit))
3. Add pagination support to retrieve more than the initial set of posts
4. Create a helper method to identify LATAM-relevant content (e.g., by language, location mentions)
5. Implement filters to focus on business-related posts
6. Add functionality to store search results temporarily
7. Test search functionality with various hashtags and locations
8. Implement error handling for failed searches and rate limiting

## 3. Extract and process business profile information [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement methods to extract business profile information from post authors and collect relevant data
### Details:
1. Create a method to extract profile information from post authors
2. Implement functionality to parse profile bio for business indicators
3. Add extraction of contact information (email, phone) when available
4. Implement location extraction and normalization
5. Create a data structure to store extracted business profiles
6. Add deduplication logic to avoid processing the same profile multiple times
7. Implement a method to export collected data to CSV/JSON
8. Test the extraction with various profile types (business, personal, etc.)
9. Add validation to ensure extracted data meets quality standards
