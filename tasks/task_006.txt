# Task ID: 6
# Title: Data Processing Module - Deduplication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to identify and remove duplicate leads
# Details:
Create a DataProcessor class with deduplication methods using Pandas. Implement: 1) Exact matching on business names, phones, or emails, 2) Fuzzy matching for similar business names (using libraries like fuzzywuzzy), 3) Configurable deduplication rules (e.g., match on name AND location or phone only), 4) Preservation of the record with the most complete information when duplicates are found. Return a cleaned DataFrame.

# Test Strategy:
Create test datasets with known duplicates in various formats. Verify all duplicates are correctly identified and the most complete records are preserved. Test with edge cases like slightly misspelled names.
