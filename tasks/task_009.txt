# Task ID: 9
# Title: Google Sheets Integration - Data Upload
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to update Google Sheets with processed lead data
# Details:
Extend the GoogleSheetsIntegration class to: 1) Convert processed DataFrame to the required format for Google Sheets, 2) Update existing sheets with new data (append or overwrite options), 3) Format the spreadsheet (headers, column widths, etc.), 4) Handle API rate limits and batch updates for efficiency, 5) Implement error recovery for failed uploads. Include a timestamp column to track when data was added.

# Test Strategy:
Test uploading various sizes of datasets. Verify data integrity by comparing source data with uploaded data. Test error recovery by simulating API failures during upload.
