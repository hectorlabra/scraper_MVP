# Task ID: 9
# Title: Google Sheets Integration - Data Upload
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to update Google Sheets with processed lead data
# Details:
Extend the GoogleSheetsIntegration class to: 1) Convert processed DataFrame to the required format for Google Sheets, 2) Update existing sheets with new data (append or overwrite options), 3) Format the spreadsheet (headers, column widths, etc.), 4) Handle API rate limits and batch updates for efficiency, 5) Implement error recovery for failed uploads. Include a timestamp column to track when data was added.

# Test Strategy:
Test uploading various sizes of datasets. Verify data integrity by comparing source data with uploaded data. Test error recovery by simulating API failures during upload.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement DataFrame to Google Sheets Format Conversion [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create methods to convert processed DataFrame data into the format required by Google Sheets API, including adding a timestamp column to track when data was added.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Add a new method `convert_dataframe_to_sheets_format(df, include_timestamp=True)` to the GoogleSheetsIntegration class
2. Implement logic to convert DataFrame to a list of lists (rows) as required by Google Sheets API
3. Add functionality to include a timestamp column when specified
4. Handle data type conversions to ensure compatibility with Google Sheets
5. Create unit tests with sample DataFrames to verify correct conversion
6. Test with various DataFrame structures and data types
7. Document the method with clear docstrings explaining parameters and return values

## 2. Implement Sheet Update Functionality with Append/Overwrite Options [completed]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create methods to update existing Google Sheets with new data, supporting both append and overwrite modes, and implementing proper formatting for headers and columns.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Add methods `append_to_sheet(sheet_id, data, range_name)` and `overwrite_sheet(sheet_id, data, range_name)` to the GoogleSheetsIntegration class
2. Implement sheet existence validation before attempting updates
3. Create a method to format spreadsheet headers and adjust column widths based on content
4. Use the Google Sheets API to perform the actual updates
5. Implement a helper method to determine the next empty row for append operations
6. Add parameters to control formatting options (bold headers, freeze panes, etc.)
7. Create integration tests that verify data is correctly written to test spreadsheets
8. Test both append and overwrite functionality with various data sizes
9. Document usage examples for both update modes

## 3. Implement Batch Updates with Rate Limiting and Error Recovery [completed]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Enhance the Google Sheets update functionality to handle API rate limits, implement batch updates for efficiency, and add error recovery mechanisms for failed uploads.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Research Google Sheets API rate limits and implement a rate limiting mechanism
2. Create a `batch_update(sheet_id, data_chunks, mode='append')` method that splits large datasets into appropriate batch sizes
3. Implement exponential backoff for API requests to handle rate limiting
4. Add error handling that catches specific API exceptions (quota exceeded, network errors, etc.)
5. Create a retry mechanism for failed batch uploads with configurable retry attempts
6. Implement logging for successful updates, rate limit hits, and errors
7. Add a recovery mechanism to track progress and resume from the last successful batch
8. Create a method to validate the final upload by comparing row counts
9. Test with large datasets that would trigger rate limits
10. Document best practices for handling large data uploads
