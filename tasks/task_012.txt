# Task ID: 12
# Title: Error Handling and Monitoring Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and monitoring
# Details:
Enhance error handling throughout the codebase: 1) Implement detailed logging with different severity levels, 2) Create a monitoring dashboard or report generation, 3) Add email notifications for critical failures, 4) Implement automatic retry logic for transient errors, 5) Create a system to track scraper health over time (success rates, data quality). Consider adding Sentry or similar error tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various error conditions and verify appropriate handling. Check that notifications are sent correctly and logs contain sufficient information for debugging.
